      <span style="font-weight: bold;">METAL SPECIATION</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Metals in the aquatic environments are an environmental concern. The
      extent of the negative impact of metals is strongly dependent on the
      molecular form of the metal. Metals may be bound to natural organic
      matter, bacterial and/or mineral surfaces. Often (but not always), the
      bound metal is less toxic and possibly less mobile then the free form.
      Analytical methods that determine forms of metal are termed speciation
      methods. Metal speciation in aquatic systems is a primary research
      interest of the CLEAR lab.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NUTRIENT REMOVAL/RECOVERY</span>:</p>
    <p>Nutrient related research involves studies on optimize phosphate removal
      during sewage treatment.&nbsp; To optimize phosphate removal it is first
      necessary to understand the mechanism of phosphate removal.&nbsp; This
      involves the application of geochemical experimental and modelling
      techniques to understanding phosphate interactions with colloids and
      surfaces.&nbsp; More recent work is moving towards nitrogen species as
      well as phosphorus and nutrient recovery rather than removal. </p>
